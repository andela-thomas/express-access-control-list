Express Access Control Lists (express-acl) enable you to manage access to your express routes and data.This is achieved through the ACL rules. ACL defines which user groups are granted access and the type of access they have against a specified resource. When a request is received against a resource, `express-acl` checks the corresponding ACL policy to verify the requester has the necessary access permissions.
